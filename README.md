### Usage
Feel free to use the contents of this repository as a reference or learning resource. Please note that some portions of the code and notes may have been sourced from various blogs, professors, and Stack Overflow, and I cannot claim that all work is entirely my own. 

### About Me
I am a student and I am trying to master these languages on my own. I try to dedicate at least one hour each day to practicing and improvement. I am currently focusing on Swift, Python and Rust as part of my daily programming study plan.
